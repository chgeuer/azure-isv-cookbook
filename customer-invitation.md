
# Invitation to our technical discovery session

Hi all, 

we're happy to welcome you to the "Azure FastTrack for ISV" program. 
You already had the initial conversation with our program management team. 
The next step to kick-off the technical workstream is the "technical discovery" session with our engineering team. 
In our joint project, I will serve as 'lead engineer', i.e. I will be your primarily entry point for technical questions, and will pull additional engineers in, if needed. 

The goal of the technical discovery session is to help me to get a deeper technical understanding of your solution's architecture, and to jointly identify the different engagements / areas where you need advisory from Azure Engineering. 

### Agenda (60-90 minutes overall)

- Introduction / Who is who
- Short overview of your solution from your customer's perspective, potentially a (quick) demo
- Overview to your solution architecture
  - Application-level components
  - Physical architecture on Azure (or the current hosting environment, in case of a migration project), incl.
    - Network topology
    - Compute tier
    - Databases and storage
    - Requirements like availability, geo-distribution, regulation and compliance, service levels
- Agreeing on a discrete set of engagements where you need our help, and their priority, such as
  - An architecture design session (in case you do not yet have an Azure architecture)
  - Iterative architecture reviews (of your architecture's evolution)
  - In-depth sessions for areas like
    - networking
    - security
    - data migration
    - deployment automation, DevOps
- Scheduling next meeting(s)

Please be prepared to present your solution's architecture in this tech discovery. If you need more information or inspiration regarding the right level of detail, please head over to https://cookbook.azureisv.com/technical-envisioning-session for samples.
