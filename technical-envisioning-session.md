# The technical envisioning session

The engineering part of an engagement usually starts with a 'technical envisioning session', during which we try to understand your system better. This session is usually time-boxed to 60 minutes, so we won't have time to go super-deep in each aspect. 

Some of our customers migrate their workloads from a different environment like AWS or on-premises datacenters to Azure, while others already have a system running on the Azure cloud, which they want to optimize. 

## Goals of the envisioning session

One goal of the 'technical envisioning session' is to convey a technical overview to us, so that your lead engineer understands the overall picture. The second goal is to break down the project down into an agreed set of discrete 'engagements'. Your lead engineer might then pull in additional engineers into these engagement.  

## Types of engagements

Each customer comes with their own sets of needs and challenges. However, there are a few typical engagement types which are common across projects and customers:

- architecture design sessions (ADS)
- architecture design review sessions (ADR)
- technology-specific deep-dives, into areas like
  - cloud deployment, infrastructure as code (IaC), deployment mechanisms (ARM templates / Bicep, Terraform,  Pulumi, imperative scripts)
  - data warehouse design
  - networking topology
  - DevOps
  - PowerBI
  - ...
