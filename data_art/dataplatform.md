## Context

When an ISV request to establish a data lake, few stratigic decsions are required to be addressed. It is imperative to create data ingestion strategies which will be aligned with the strategic path of the ISV, in regards to on boarding new customers, ensuring data residency, supporting GDPR regulation where applicable and securing the data.

There would be few use cases that can be addressed by a lake.

- Applicative - The ISV buisness is primerly generating actionable data for the customers, e.g. suggesting when to perform specific activity.
